Test your skills: Images and Form Elements-Task Two

In this task, you have a simple form. Your task is to make the following changes to the way this form looks:

1. Use attribute selectors to target the search field and button inside .myform.
2. Make the form field and button use the same text size as the rest of the form.
3. Give the form field and button 10 px of padding.
4. Give the button a purple background (I used rebeccapurple), white foreground, no border and rounded corners of 5px.
